NeuroLoopGain analyzer for EEG (ElectroEncephaloGram) signals.

Copyright 1980-2012, Bob Kemp and Marco Roessen, The Netherlands.

The first (closed source) version (1.0) of this software was developed in 1980-2011 by Bob Kemp and  Marco Roessen, based on the mathematical derivations and specifications in the article "Analysis of a sleep-dependent neuronal feedback loop: the slow-wave microcontinuity of the EEG" by B Kemp B, AH Zwinderman, B Tuk, HAC Kamphuisen and JJL Oberyé in IEEE-BME 47(9), 2000: 1185-1194. This closed source version 1.0 was available from http://www.edfplus.info/downloads/software/NeuroLoopGain.zip and was used in scientific articles till 2011.

The closed source version 1.0 was converted to the first open-source version (2.0) in 2012 by Bob Kemp and Marco Roessen and used large portions that were converted in 2011 by Diego Álvarez Estévez from A Coruña, Spain. Versions 1.0 and 2.0 have identical output except for minor (less than 0.1%) round-off differences.

Both versions 1.0 and 2.0 use the open EDF specification at http://www.edfplus.info/specs/edf.html for the file format of both the input file (that contains the EEG signal) and the output file (that contains the Gain signal).

Versions 1.0 and 2.0 as well as the most recent version and the mentioned article can be downloaded from the project repository at Google, http://code.google.com/p/neuroloopgain/
